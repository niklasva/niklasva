#+html:<summary><b>Experience</b></summary>
I am most enthusiastic about high-performance, low-level code, but I also have experience in full-stack web development and database optimization.

I have also specialized in development of integration software, harmonizing colossal, mission-critical systems.
In addition to this, I have also done work in Unix system management and configuration, focusing on Linux and IBM AIX.
