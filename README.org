** About me
🔭 I'm Niklas. I am a software engineer currently residing in Gothenburg, Sweden.

🔐 Present mission: Embedded locksmithing at [[http://parakey.co][@parakey.co]]\\
🧙‍♂️ Previously: Senior software wrangler and integration guru at [[http://imi.se][@imi.se]]

I am most enthusiastic about high-performance, low-level code, but I also have experience in full-stack web development and database optimization.

I have also specialized in development of integration software, harmonizing colossal, mission-critical systems.
In addition to this, I have also done work in Unix system management and configuration, focusing on Linux and IBM AIX. 

And probably a lot more. Let's talk.
